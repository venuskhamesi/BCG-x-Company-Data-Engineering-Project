 📊 PowerCo Churn Prediction – A BCG X Virtual Project

Welcome to my end-to-end data science project, completed through the BCG X Virtual Experience Program on Forage. This case study reflects the real-world nature of consulting—where the data is messy, the goals are evolving, and the challenge is to turn insights into impact.

🧭 Project Snapshot

PowerCo, a major energy provider, was seeing signs of increased customer churn. My role was to dig into the data, understand customer behavior, and develop a predictive model to help PowerCo proactively retain its customers.

I followed the complete data science process—from framing the problem to presenting actionable business insights.

 🗂️ Project Breakdown

 1. 🧠 Understanding the Business
- Translated a high-level client concern into concrete, answerable questions.
- Explored price sensitivity as a possible driver of churn.

 2. 🧪 Exploring & Cleaning the Data
- Performed data profiling to identify trends, missing values, and outliers.
- Visualized key usage and churn patterns to guide feature development.

 3. 🛠️ Feature Engineering
- Created 11 custom features based on usage behavior and pricing patterns.
- Applied business logic to ensure features reflected real-world context.

 4. 🧮 Modeling & Evaluation
- Built a Random Forest Classifier with 85% accuracy.
- Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV for better results.

 5. 📢 Insights & Recommendations
- Discovered that churn is multi-faceted—price matters, but isn’t the only factor.
- Presented findings in a clear, concise summary tailored for business stakeholders.
