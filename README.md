# 🔍 BCG X Data Science Project – Customer Churn Prediction for PowerCo

Welcome to my end-to-end data science project completed as part of the **BCG X Virtual Experience Program on Forage**. This project reflects real consulting scenarios where data is complex, client problems are ambiguous, and the goal is to deliver clear, actionable insights that drive measurable business impact.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This case study focuses on **PowerCo**, a major gas and electricity provider concerned about losing customers. The objective was to analyze customer behavior and develop a machine learning model to predict churn, following the complete data science lifecycle—mirroring the approach used by consultants at BCG X.

## 📌 Core Project Stages

### 1. **Business Understanding & Problem Framing**
- Interpreted vague client objectives and reframed them into actionable business questions.
- Explored the concept of **price sensitivity** as a potential driver of customer churn.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Cleaning**
- Conducted thorough EDA using Python to identify trends, outliers, and missing values.
- Visualized key patterns related to churn and energy usage behavior.

### 3. **Feature Engineering**
- Created **11 new features**, including time-based and pricing-related attributes.
- Applied domain knowledge to improve feature relevance.

### 4. **Modeling & Evaluation**
- Built a **Random Forest Classifier**, achieving **85% accuracy**.
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Assessed the impact of hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) on model performance.

### 5. **Insights & Recommendations**
- Identified **price sensitivity** as a factor, but not the most dominant one in predicting churn.
- Delivered a concise **executive summary** outlining actionable recommendations for client stakeholders.
