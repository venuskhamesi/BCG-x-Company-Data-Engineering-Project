🔍 PowerCo Churn Prediction – A BCG X Virtual Project
Welcome to my end-to-end data science project, completed through the BCG X Virtual Experience Program on Forage. This case study mirrors real consulting work—where data is messy, goals aren’t always clear, and the challenge is to deliver insights that matter.

🚀 Project Snapshot
PowerCo, a major energy provider, is concerned about rising customer churn. My task: analyze customer behavior and build a predictive model to anticipate who’s likely to leave—and why.

Following the full data science lifecycle, I approached this problem like a consultant would: data-driven, strategic, and business-focused.

📌 Project Breakdown
1. 🔍 Understanding the Business
Translated a vague client brief into focused, solvable business questions.

Investigated how price sensitivity might influence churn.

2. 🧹 Data Exploration & Cleaning
Explored the data using Python to uncover trends, gaps, and outliers.

Created visualizations to understand usage behavior and churn patterns.

3. 🧠 Feature Engineering
Built 11 new features, focusing on time-based behavior and pricing.

Applied energy industry context to boost feature relevance.

4. 🤖 Modeling & Evaluation
Trained a Random Forest Classifier that reached 85% accuracy.

Used precision, recall, and F1-score for balanced model evaluation.

Tuned parameters using GridSearchCV to improve performance.

5. 💼 Insights & Action
Found that while price matters, it's not the sole reason for churn.

Delivered an executive-friendly summary with targeted recommendations.

🎯 Key Takeaways
Through this project, I learned to think like a consultant—solving ambiguous problems with limited data. I also sharpened hands-on skills in:

🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis

🛠️ Feature Engineering

🤖 Predictive Modeling

💬 Business Storytelling

I completed the entire pipeline independently, as it would be done in a real-world client engagement.

🛠️ Tools & Tech
Languages & Libraries: Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Modeling: Random Forest, Mutual Information

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Consulting Skills: Stakeholder-focused analysis and executive summaries

📈 Final Highlights
Engineered 11 new features to capture deeper behavioral signals

Selected 38 numeric variables using both statistical and model-based methods

Achieved 85% model accuracy

Delivered insights to help PowerCo refine its customer retention strategy

💡 Final Thoughts
This project was more than a modeling task—it was a hands-on simulation of how data science fuels real business decisions. It challenged me to ask the right questions, explore creatively, and communicate insights with clarity.
